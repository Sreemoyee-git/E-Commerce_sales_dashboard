# E-Commerce_sales_dashboard

Problem Statement:

The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the sales performance and customer behavior of an e-commerce company across various product categories, sales channels, and geographical regions. This will aid in identifying trends, improving customer retention, and optimizing sales and inventory strategies. The analysis includes product performance, sales trends, order cancellations, fulfillment channels, and sales by region, aimed at improving overall profitability and efficiency.

1. Sales Overview:

Analyzed total revenue, average order value, and retention rate. I visualized sales by product category, focusing on the highest-performing products such as "Set" and "Kurta." This was used to track revenue distribution across categories and product performance.

2. Sales by Geography:

Mapped sales data to countries and states to understand the geographical distribution of sales. This helped identify top regions with high sales volume and highlighted the regions that need more marketing focus.

3. B2B vs. B2C Sales Analysis:

Analyzed the breakdown of B2B vs. B2C sales, where it was found that the majority of sales (53.62%) are from B2B transactions. This comparison was useful for strategizing business expansion and customer segmentation.

4. Order Cancellation and Return Rates:

Measured and visualized the cancellation and return rates by category. Categories with the highest return rates, such as "Western Dress" and "Kurta," were identified. This helped in understanding potential pain points that could lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue.

5. Seasonal Sales Trends:

Analyzed sales trends over different months to understand seasonality. A noticeable spike in sales was observed in April 2022, providing insight into key sales periods that the business can capitalize on for future promotions.

6. Amazon vs. Merchant Fulfillment:

Examined sales fulfillment data to compare the efficiency of Amazon vs. Merchant fulfillment channels. The analysis showed that Amazon fulfills a smaller portion of orders, indicating an opportunity to optimize the merchant fulfillment process or expand through Amazon.

7. Average Quantity Sold by Category:

Analyzed the average quantity sold per category to highlight popular items, with categories such as "Dupatta" and "Saree" performing well. This was visualized with a color-coded chart to make data interpretation easier.

8. Creating PPT : Created ppt presentation for the dashboard.

Tools Used:

Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard with data visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines.

Python: Used for Data cleaning and data modifying.

Recommendations:

1. Optimize Product Offerings:

Focus marketing and inventory strategies on high-performing categories like "Set" and "Kurta." Consider introducing more variations or discounts to boost sales in other underperforming categories.

2. Improve Customer Retention:

With a retention rate of 56.81%, consider implementing loyalty programs, promotions, and follow-up campaigns to further increase repeat customers. Also, investigate reasons behind high cancellation rates in specific categories and address them.

3. Geographical Focus:

Expand marketing efforts in states with lower sales. For instance, regions outside the top-selling areas (Bengaluru, Hyderabad) can be targeted with localized promotions or advertisements.

4. Fulfillment Efficiency:

Given that merchant fulfillment represents a larger portion of the sales, evaluate opportunities to optimize logistics or explore scaling through platforms like Amazon to improve fulfillment rates and reduce delivery times.

5. Monitor Seasonal Trends:

Capitalize on peak sales periods identified in the seasonal trends chart, especially the spikes in April 2022. Prepare promotional campaigns in advance to maximize revenue during these months.

Conclusion:

The analysis of the e-commerce company's sales data has provided critical insights into the product performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency across different regions and sales channels. By leveraging this data, the company can optimize its sales strategy, inventory management, and marketing efforts. Continuous monitoring of trends, return/cancellation rates, and fulfillment channels will allow for timely adjustments and ensure sustained growth and customer satisfaction.
